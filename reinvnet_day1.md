## 10/5/2015 - AWS re:Invent (Day 1)

The first day of AWS re:Invent at The Venetian in Las Vegas. No real exciting
events to speak of today!

#### Registration

The day started with registration at 7am, and it was already pretty crowded when
I showed up around 7:30. Registration included a pretty cool zip up hoodie!

#### Certification

I took my AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam and passed! Anyone interested
in taking this course should be sure to prepare fairly well in advance - the
exam itself is **fairly** heavy on the topic of DynamoDB, almost to the point of
feeling like a DynamoDB exam with a brief overview on everything else.

#### Tomorrow

The real show starts tomorrow, including the welcome reception.
